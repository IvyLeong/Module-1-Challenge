# Module-1-Challenge    
Based on the “Outcome based on Goals” graph, the lower the goal amount, the higher the Kickstarter successful rates are. There are higher successful rate if the goal is set under $15000. The cancellation rate and failed rate also increased with the increasing goal amount. Based on the “Outcome based on Launch date” graph, May is the month with the highest successful rate. The failed campaigns were not affected by the month of the year as the percentages are about the same throughout the year.
One of the limitations is that when the goal is $35000-$45000, the successful rate increased instead of decreased. There may be other factors that affected its trend. Another limitation is that the “country” section is needed to be filtered out according to the planning kickstarter. Additional graphs that will be helpful are “spotlight vs Outcome” and “Duration of kickstarter vs outcome”. We can get some info if the use of spotlight would increase the success rate. Also, we can know what duration of the kickstarter would be the most successful and plan accordingly.
